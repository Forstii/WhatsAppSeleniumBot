For New Years Eve I programmed this small Programm which can send Messages at a from you choosen time point.(So i can whish everyone a happy new year at 24:00 o'clock)
This programm was specifically programmed for my version of MacOs (BigSur) but it can also work for any other Systeme whith some minor adjustments.
It uses Data from a german website to tell the time, if you want to use it for another timzone, you should change the website and also the part where it looks for the time.Any kind of feedback is welcome :)
